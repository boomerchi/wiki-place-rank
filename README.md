A project for computing the PageRank of Wikipedia pages for places.

Specifically, a current Wikipedia XML dump is used to generate the
Wikipedia link graph.  The Geonames RDF dump is used for a mapping
between Geonames entities and Wikipedia pages.  The resulting
collection of ranked locations can be used for estimating the
prominence of each interpretation of a toponym.
